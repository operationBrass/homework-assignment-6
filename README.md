The Weather Dashboard uses API service to return to you a weather forecast with a 5 day outlook. 

# Technologies Used

The [OpenWeatherAPI]( https://github.com/operationBrass/homework-assignment-6/blob/main/LICENSE "OpenWeather") was used to retrieve weather reports. All styles were created using standard CSS and Javascript. 

# Challenges

During this assignment i was introduced to API calls and Promises. There were a few hits and misses during creation such as error handling. It was also interesting to note the API calls had different attributes to define the City. I.E using the Lat and Long was needed for the one call API. Further learning was required on utilising the search history to act as a link to update the weather for that city.
